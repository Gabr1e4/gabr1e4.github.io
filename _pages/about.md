Welcome! My name is Haozhe Tan. You can also call me Haozhe.
Currently, I am a second year PhD student at [ISEM](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/isem/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). My research focuses on topics related to discrete optimization (mixed-inter programming in particular) and optimization under uncertainty (robust and online optimization). My supervisor is [Dr. Guanyi Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/guanyiwang).

Prior to this, I obtain my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). During my undergrad studies, I am fortunate to get research guidance from [Dr. Jicong Fan](https://jicongfan.github.io).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
